## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2025 to better understand:

1. Some demographic features around respondents.
2. How people responded to AI?
3. What decided people trust or not trust AI tools.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks Stake_flow_AI_Analysis.ipynb available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@wykl9891/ai-trust-analysis-229ab427b130).
